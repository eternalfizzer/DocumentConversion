	Consider setting your antivirus solution to update and run at least once per week on your workstations. |
	Consider implementing formal change control procedures to evaluate and if necessary roll back changes made to the organization's systems. |
	Consider archiving audit logs for all user activity as appropriate.  Audit logs make both troubleshooting and investigations easier and less time consuming. |
	Assign someone to review your audit logs on a periodic basis.  Many instances of fraud have been uncovered by a casual glance at log files. |
	Test your backup media from time to time, especially if you are using cassette media.  Backup media has a finite lifespan and must be replaced periodically. |
	Consider whether you really need sensitive personal information to be stored on laptop computers.  In cases where the answer is yes, continue with whole disk encryption. |
	Consider whether or not business applications really require sensitive personal information to be collected via the web.  In cases where the answer is yes, ensure that you continue the use of appropriate encryption. |
	Consider formally testing your websites for common vulnerabilities on a periodic basis. |
	Consider whether or not your business really needs to store credit card information.  In cases where the answer is yes, continue the use of appropriate encryption.
